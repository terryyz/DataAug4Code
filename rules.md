# Adding a new entry

Format your paper as the following:

| Paper |  Dataset |
| -- | -- | 
| Best Data Augmentation Technique [(ACL '27)](https://github.com/terryyz/DataAug4Code/) |  CodeXGLUE |

Specifically:

- Only include the title of the paper.
- Capitalize all important words in the title.
- Include the conference in parenthesis, with a link to the paper. Use ACL Anthology if possible. Abbreviate if it's a workshop paper. You could also use the ArXiv link (e.g., for AAAI, this might be a good idea). If your paper is ArXiv-only, just put 'ArXiv'.
- Use '27 instead of 2027. 
- Include the code if you have it.
- Add the papers chronologically.
